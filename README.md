Explainations:


For the design of the controller I used a combination of a vibration motor, a breadboard, a gyro sensor, a button, and an arduino. With these components the user is capable of moving the bird up, down, left, and right, and attack. The vibration motor will notify the user that they are being aimed at by the hunter and to move out of the way. 

The design of the control is very basic and is designed to be holdable in one hand. The design can be improved by decreasing the size of the controller as there is a lot of unused space within it. This would make it more ergonomic as well as lighter on the hand.

The drawings for the the controller show that the controller is about 20cm in length and 7cm in height which is generally quite big for a controller. 




Tinekr cad explaination:
The tinkercad demo shows the general functionality of the controller, it vibrates when the player is being aimed at, there are two tilt sensors that allow the player to control the x and y axis and then a button to attack the hunter which also triggers the vibration motor. These components were chosen to maximize immersion and ease of use as there is only 2 inputs the olayer needs to deal with.
